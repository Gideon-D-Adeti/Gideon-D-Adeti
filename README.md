👋 Hi, I’m Gideon Delali Adeti, a self-taught software developer passionate about science and technology.

👀 I’m currently exploring coding through freeCodeCamp’s core curriculum, driven by curiosity to understand the digital world’s inner workings.

🌱 Beyond coding, my fascination with science—especially neuroscience—inspires me to blend my skills into the field of biomedical engineering, with a focus on neural engineering.

📚 Continuous learning is my mantra, and I'm eyeing data science as the next step.

⚡ Fun facts:
- I enjoy freeride mountain biking and am working on mastering some basic skills like wheelie and manual.
- Je suis en train d'apprendre le français sur Duolingo! [Check out my progress](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Gideon-D-Adeti?via=share_profile_link)
- I also enjoy playing chess, and my highest Elo so far is 1042. [Friend me on Chess.com](https://friend.chess.com/s7eDE) and let’s play sometime!
  
💞️ Let’s connect – I’m always up for collaboration and exploring new opportunities!
